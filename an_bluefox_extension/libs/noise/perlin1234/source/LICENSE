/*
 * This implementation is "Improved Noise" as presented by
 * Ken Perlin at Siggraph 2002. The 3D function is a direct port
 * of his Java reference code which was once publicly available
 * on www.noisemachine.com (although I cleaned it up, made it
 * faster and made the code more readable), but the 1D, 2D and
 * 4D functions were implemented from scratch by me.
 *
 * This is a backport to C of my improved noise class in C++
 * which was included in the Aqsis renderer project.
 * It is highly reusable without source code modifications.
